My name is Tuan Nguyen. 
I came from Vietnam. This is my 2nd semester at Mason and my major is Data Analytic Engineering. My previous major was Water Resources Engineering, and I had some experience working with weather data during my previous job.

My goal is to learn more about machine learning/deep learning and their application to apply them in the field of hydrology. I'm interested in studying the application of Neural Network in weather data forecasting.

I have experience with Excel models, VBA, C and I'm familiar with the basics in Python, SQL, and R.

It is a pleasure to meet you and I am looking forward to study this course.
